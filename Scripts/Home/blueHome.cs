// The blueHome class represents the home area for the blue player in a Ludo game.
// This class inherits from the ludoHome base class, which contains the common functionalities and properties needed for a player's home area.
// As a derived class, blueHome can override inherited methods from ludoHome to implement blue-specific behavior or can simply use the base class functionality if no blue-specific behavior is needed.
// Typically, this class would be attached to a GameObject in the Unity scene that represents the blue player's home area on the game board.
//
// Key functionalities that might be inherited or customized include:
// - Initializing the home area at the start of the game.
// - Managing player pieces that are currently in the home area.
// - Handling events or conditions that allow a player piece to leave the home area and enter the game board.
//
// Note: The actual implementations of Start() and Update() methods are empty in this template,
// indicating that this class relies on inherited behavior from ludoHome or that specific behaviors need to be implemented based on game requirements.

public class blueHome : ludoHome
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        // Initialization code specific to the blue player's home area could go here.
        // If there's no blue-specific initialization required, this method can remain empty
        // and will inherit any initialization behavior from the ludoHome base class.
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // Update logic specific to the blue player's home area could go here.
        // This could include checking conditions to move a piece out of the home area or
        // other game state updates. If no blue-specific update behavior is needed, this method
        // can remain empty and will inherit any update behavior from the ludoHome base class.
