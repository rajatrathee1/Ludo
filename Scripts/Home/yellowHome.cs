// The yellowHome class is specialized for managing the home base of the yellow player in a Ludo-like game, inheriting from the ludoHome class.
// It serves as a template for implementing yellow-player-specific functionalities, such as managing the spawning and safety of player pieces,
// and could be customized to include visual effects, animations, or interactions exclusive to the yellow home.
// Initial setup and frame-by-frame updates can be implemented in the Start and Update methods, respectively, to adapt the home base
// according to the game's rules and dynamics.
public class yellowHome : ludoHome
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        // Initialization code for the yellow home, possibly setting up player pieces or visual elements, goes here.
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // Frame-by-frame logic to maintain or update the yellow home's state can be implemented here.
    }
