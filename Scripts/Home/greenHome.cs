// The greenHome class extends the ludoHome class to implement the functionality specific to the green player's home in a Ludo-like game.
// This class could manage behaviors, animations, or interactions unique to the green home base, such as spawning player pieces,
// handling player pieces returning to the home after being captured, or any other green-team-specific logic.
// As with other home classes, it starts with Unity's default Start and Update methods, which can be expanded to include
// custom logic for initializing the home state and updating it throughout the game.
public class greenHome : ludoHome
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        // Initialization code specific to the green home can be added here.
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // Code to update the green home's state in each frame can be added here.
    }
}
