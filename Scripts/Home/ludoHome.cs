// The ludoHome class serves as a base class for defining the common functionalities and properties of a player's home base in a Ludo-like game.
// It is intended to be extended by color-specific subclasses that represent each player's home area on the board.
// The class manages player pieces that start in or return to the home area and associates a dice with the home for determining movement.

    // allowing for player-specific roll outcomes that dictate the movement of their pieces.
